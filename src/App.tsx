Q: What should we know about your life story in a few sentences?
A: I’ve always been someone who loves solving problems — whether it was tackling tough math during JEE prep, writing code for ICPC, or building real-world solutions at Samsung R&D. Over time, that curiosity turned into a passion for creating things that actually help people — from Android apps to intelligent systems that make life a little easier and happier.

Q: What work did you do in Samsung?
A: I was part of the application development team for Tizen-based digital appliances, such as smart washers and refrigerators. My primary work involved using C# .NET and Samsung's internal frameworks, Flux and OneUI, to build features. I also worked on an AI project for sound-based anomaly detection as part of an internal team competition.

Q: What’s your #1 superpower?
A: Turning tricky requirements into working prototypes overnight—thanks to strong fundamentals and a love for problem-solving.

Q: What are the top 3 areas you’d like to grow in?
A: 1) Scalable backend architecture, 2) Production-ready ML models, 3) Leadership and team mentoring.

Q: What misconception do your coworkers have about you?
A: That I’m all code-all the time—they don’t know I also enjoy mentoring juniors and writing clear documentation.

Q: How do you push your boundaries and limits?
A: By tackling projects that scare me—like edge-computing with Docker or building complete LMS backends—and learning on the fly.

Q: Tell me about the most challenging technical project you've worked on.
A: One of my most challenging projects was during my internship at Samsung R&D, where I worked on sound anomaly detection in washing machines. It required a full ML pipeline — from sourcing raw audio data from YouTube, preprocessing with ffmpeg and librosa, to model training and thresholding using percentile-based logic. The toughest part was live monitoring and managing real-time inference — a true blend of software engineering and research.

Q: Describe a time you faced a difficult bug. How did you solve it?
A: While implementing JWT-based authentication in a Flask API, I encountered a persistent token decoding error. After isolating parts of the code and using debugging tools, I realized the token secret key wasn't loaded properly in certain environments. I solved it by restructuring the config loading and writing tests to catch this earlier in the future.

Q: How has competitive programming prepared you for real-world software development?
A: It taught me how to break complex problems into smaller parts, optimize under constraints, and write clean, bug-free code fast. These skills transfer directly to debugging, designing efficient systems, and performing under tight deadlines.

Q: Can you talk about a time you had to work under a tight deadline?
A: During our ICPC regionals preparation, we had just two weeks to cover graph theory, DP, and advanced number theory. We created a sprint-style plan and solved 10–15 problems daily, reviewed each other’s code, and simulated contests. That level of discipline helped me later in internship tasks with tough timelines.

Q: What was your most significant learning from your internship at Samsung R&D?
A: I learned how research and engineering intersect in applied AI. From sourcing non-standard datasets to handling real-time edge inference challenges, I gained a solid understanding of the constraints and trade-offs in deploying ML systems.

Q: Describe a situation where you had to learn a new technology quickly.
A: At my Samsung R&D internship, I had to rapidly learn an entirely new stack: C# with .NET on the backend and Samsung's proprietary Tizen frameworks, Flux and OneUI, on the front end. I got up to speed in a few weeks and successfully delivered a new feature using these technologies.
Q: How do you handle constructive criticism or feedback on your code?
A: I welcome it. Code reviews at Samsung taught me to separate the feedback from the ego. I treat suggestions as learning points and often revisit PR comments later to reflect on how I’ve improved.

Q: Tell me about a time a project didn't go as planned. What happened?
A: In my checkers AI game project, I initially underestimated the complexity of Alpha-Beta pruning with multiple depth levels. The model gave incorrect moves. I took a step back, added logging, visualized state trees, and fixed edge-case evaluations — turning failure into a valuable debugging lesson.

Q: You mentioned an interest in scalable backends. What are some key principles you know for designing one?
A: Modular design, statelessness, horizontal scaling, caching layers (like Redis), and proper database indexing. I also follow principles like graceful degradation, rate limiting, and async processing where needed.

Q: What's the difference between theory and practice in software engineering, based on your experience?
A: In theory, things are perfect — code compiles, edge cases are rare. In practice, you have real-world constraints like deadlines, broken libraries, or partial data. Practical engineering requires flexibility and prioritization.

Q: How do you ensure the quality and readability of your code?
A: I follow naming conventions, modularize logic, write meaningful comments, and rely on linters. I also try to write small unit tests, especially for utility functions and data transformations.

Q: What are your favorite development tools and why?
A: VS Code for Python, Android Studio for mobile, Postman for API testing, and Git for version control. These tools boost my productivity and debugging efficiency.

Q: What steps would you take to deploy a machine learning model into production?
A: I'd first package the model using joblib or ONNX, then serve it via a Flask or FastAPI endpoint. I'd containerize it using Docker, test edge cases, and monitor latency and drift post-deployment.

Q: What technologies are you most proficient in, and why?
A: I'm strongest in Java, Python, and C++. Java was central to my Android development work, especially in apps like RailQuest. Python is my go-to for machine learning and backend work, while C++ powers my competitive programming. I'm also proficient with Node.js, Flask, SQL, and Docker, all of which I’ve used in full-stack and real-world projects.

Q: Walk me through the architecture of an Android app you have built.
A: In RailQuest, a railway ticket booking app, I used a modular MVVM architecture. The frontend was built in Java and XML. Firebase handled authentication and real-time updates. For the backend, I initially mocked APIs, then integrated a Node.js backend hosted on Firebase Functions, which handled core booking logic and database operations.

Q: What are you looking for in your first full-time role after graduation?
A: I want to join a team that values learning, ownership, and real-world impact. A place where I can work on backend systems or ML pipelines, while growing through mentorship and contribution.

Q: Why are you interested in working for our company specifically?
A: I admire your engineering culture and product focus. Your team's work in scalable systems and innovation aligns with my interests, and I’d love to contribute while learning from the best.

Q: Where do you see yourself technically in the next 3-5 years?
A: I aim to be a software, backend engineer who can independently own features and mentor juniors. I also want to contribute to open-source and possibly co-author a research paper or two.

Q: You listed leadership as a growth area. Why is that important to you?
A: Great engineers are often great leaders. I’ve seen how technical leadership boosts project success and team morale. I want to grow into someone who uplifts teams and drives clarity.

Q: What kind of company culture do you thrive in?
A: One that encourages curiosity, candid feedback, collaboration, and personal growth. I do best when surrounded by people smarter than me, pushing the boundaries.

Q: What motivates you to code outside of your academic coursework?
A: The joy of building things. I love solving real problems, whether it's through a weekend Flask API, an Android app, or a new algorithm I picked up.

Q: How do you prefer to collaborate with a team?
A: I like async communication for updates and live discussions for brainstorming. I believe in shared ownership and proactive feedback. Tools like GitHub and Slack are part of my workflow.

Q: Your profile mentions you enjoy mentoring. Can you give an example?
A: As Programming Club Coordinator at IIIT Guwahati, I led sessions on DP, graph theory, and problem-solving. I mentored juniors preparing for ICPC and helped several improve their CF ratings.

Q: How do you stay updated with the latest trends in technology?
A: I follow dev blogs, Twitter/X accounts of top engineers, newsletters like TLDR and Hacker News, and watch YouTube channels like Fireship and ThePrimeagen.

Q: What are you passionate about outside of technology?
A: I love watching and playing cricket — it’s a big part of how I relax and stay active. I also enjoy playing chess, which helps me think strategically and stay mentally sharp.

Q: How would your friends or colleagues describe you?
A: Focused, reliable, and always up for a challenge. Someone who pushes hard but stays humble — and cracks the occasional joke when things get too intense.
